In this version we've added support for the following Ant Neuro devices:

* ANT_NEURO_EE_410_BOARD
* ANT_NEURO_EE_411_BOARD
* ANT_NEURO_EE_430_BOARD

Ant Neuro provides medical grade FDA certified devices and we are looking forward to add other boards from this company soon.

We've used SDK provided by Ant Neuro company which works for Windows and Linux OSes.
